A travel journal application built in React. This project is a part of a free React course available through [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), created by [Bob Ziroll](https://twitter.com/bobziroll).

Join me in following this course! So far, I can confidently say that I highly recommend it. Bob Ziroll and Scrimba have made it incredibly easy to follow along. You can access the course for free: [Free React Course for 2022](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/free-react-course-2022/)
